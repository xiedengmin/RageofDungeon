# GodotHFSM

![HFSM for Godot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BangL/GodotHFSM/master/docs/Banner.png)

A simple yet powerful **hierarchical finite state machine** for the Godot-Mono game engine, based on [UnityHFSM 2.0.1](https://github.com/Inspiaaa/UnityHFSM/tree/eb590da7fb7680684ffc1b6801cc50c46417c38d). Just as it's almost identical upstream, it is scalable and customizable by being **class-based**, but also supports functions (lambdas) for **rapid prototyping**.

Thanks to overloading, it minimizes boilerplate code while still supporting **generics**.

It has a special focus on the temporal aspects of state transitions, making it ideal for timing and synchronization sensitive problems.
