name="HFSM"
description="A simple yet powerful hierarchical finite state machine for the Godot-Mono game engine, based on UnityHFSM 2.0.1. Just as it's almost identical upstream, it is scalable and customizable by being class-based, but also supports functions (lambdas) for rapid prototyping.
Thanks to overloading, it minimizes boilerplate code while still supporting generics.
It has a special focus on the temporal aspects of state transitions, making it ideal for timing and synchronization sensitive problems."
